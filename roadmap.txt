Core:
    Add support for multi-valued/continuous treatments
    Add annotations to simulators that indicate whether a certain feature is
        - continuous, positive, categorical, etc.
    Improve the speed of all of the Python simulators using Numba and JIT compilation of critical sections
    Expand the set of causal inference algorithms available in Python
    Expand the library of examples included with WhyNot


Sequential decision making:
    Increase the number of environments available for sequential decision making
    Incorporate baseline sequential decision making algorithms
    

Causal graph discovery:
    Increase the set of simulator that supports causal graph generation (esp. world 2 and world 3)
    Incorporate baseline causal graph discovery methods
